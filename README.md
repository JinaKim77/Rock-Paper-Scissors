    Rock-Paper-Scissors
</h2>
<br>

### Repository Description 
The game has two players.<br> In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" â€” rock, paper, or scissors.<br> Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper. Players can play a single round, or "best of three", or any number of other options.
